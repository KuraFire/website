# How much do we mint and how often?

> Goal: tokens represent the value created by the community. 

At the end of the day, this is the most important part of the system. Mint too much and inflation kills the market. Mint too little and people aren't incentivized to contribute. How do we figure this out?

If the goal is for tokens to be representative of the value created by the community, then the cumulative sum of all tokens minted needs to represent the cumulative amount of value created by the community.

<Highlight color="purple">Measuring</Highlight>

What is valuable to us?

We can define this cumulative sum (the thing we care about) as a positive KPI that we want it to go up. As thing we care about goes up, then we mint tokens in proportion to that thing. Number go up!

Pick a way to represent the phenomenon you want ([https://youtu.be/cpHWegbGgWc?t=401](https://youtu.be/cpHWegbGgWc?t=401))
- respect the process of making up numbers rigorously
- what is "valuable" is a subjective thing
- number needs to be positive and get bigger as things get better (can be a negative measure transformed into a positive number that meets the domain constraints)

State the subjective goal
- supply / KPI relationship
- supply needs to be bound to the KPI

The ability to construct the relationships is not the same as knowing what KPI to drive what you want to have happen
- You need to be able to clearly state your objective.
- Tokens need to be dominated by a measure ⇒ drive towards equilibrium

The world needs to want the KPI to be high, otherwise the token isn't going to be valuable. 

Price is how valuable the world thinks the KPI is worth, because the policy enforces the relationship of the token supply to the KPI. If KPI go up, demand go up, token price go up.
- if F is gamable and M is not valuable, then token not super valuable
- need to be able to change the system when someone figures out how to game it (SourceCred will help with this)
- The "spirit of F" is essential so that you can recognize an exploit vs the game itself - then can adjust to maintain F

General pattern is solving the control theory problem
- want a policy that goes to 1 in the limit, but is not at 1 at any given time

Creates a family of things that will make sense, but some that don't, and the similar use-cases that work will emerge. 

Need to figure out what the signals are that drive the policy
- new users
- money in
- Cred activity
- etc...

What are we actually controlling?
- Monetary policy of the system
- DAO needs the ability to change the policy

m for measurement
- red: raw signal (positive)

k is the cumulative sum
- purple: positive and monotonic (going up)

Real-world process of noisy signals ⇒ processing ⇒ number go up
- processing: scalar positive measure
- monotonic sum of scalar positive measure

`f` is an intuition of a measure of value (measuring)

`g` enforces a limiting factor and is derived from the property being enforced (g is not fixed, dependent on what is being limited) (minting)

`allocation` is the distribution policy (harvest)
- this is up to the community, but if `f` and `g` are right this is fine because we already figured out how many tokens to mint (the hard part)

p is not price
- mapping between signals


<Highlight color="red">Minting</Highlight>

How do we maintain a relationship between our measure of value and our continuous token supply? 

The control problem (`g`) is the most important part.  
- `f` is a business problem (see linked video)
- `g` is a math problem
- `allocation` is a governance problem

The system isolates 1 from 3 via 2 (the minting policy). This means that 1 and 3 can be flexibly, but 2 needs to be rooted in a solid cryptoeconomic policy. 

If minting relates to supply, then we need a policy based on m and k
- deta_s_t is a policy function of the previous k_t s_t

<Highlight color="purple">Allocation</Highlight>

How do we want to allocate tokens after we mint them?

Minting is not business logic, it's a statement about a limit.
- You can get a mixture of flexibility and assertion through limiting properties 
- Need to make it so that people get the idea, but without having to do it themselves
- Keeping the limiting factor as a limiting policy gives it flexibility to oscilate around the real value, giving the system the ability to modulate as things change
- If you want the system to have good dynamic evolutionary properties need to talk about them in terms of limiting behavior 

Could mint into a vault of Grain

Then have a policy (slow/fast) to then release that to players (vesting)

DAO can design

slow/fast as community vesting or at the individual level

# Notes

Control theory
- controlling a physical process and driving it towards desired properties

> Talk about how the supply schedule is super important as well as various governance mechanisms (voting, court, validators) that can ensure that minting is done in a fair and reasonable way.

Things can be unbounded without actually being unbounded (percentages)

# Case Study: ETH2

measure KPI based on gas because gas is a measure of productivity of the network

want utilization value to grow relative to share of usage

more use cases drive demand, but gas is the floor
- swap gas for cred and we have a more fuzzy model of the same system

Cred for a SaaS project
- `f` as revenue of the community
- mint tokens based on belief of future revenue production

time is a very very important aspect of these things
