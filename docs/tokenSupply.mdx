# How much do we mint and how often?

> Goal: make tokens represent the value created by the community. 

The process of minting tokens is arguably the most important part of the system. Mint too much and inflation kills the market. Mint too little and people aren't incentivized to contribute. How do we figure this out?

If the goal is for tokens to be representative of the value created by the community, then the cumulative sum of all tokens minted needs to represent the cumulative amount of value created by the community.

<Highlight color="purple">Measuring</Highlight>

### TL;DR: Real-world process of noisy signals ⇒ processing ⇒ number go up.

The goal of AraCred is to recognize and reward contributions. What is valuable will be different for each project. As such we need a system that generally tracks engagement and activity, but also allows the community to decide what is the most important to them.  

More concretely this looks like creating metrics for all of the complex things that humans do. These metrics can then be combined to create a cumulative KPI that represents "value," as it's defined by that community. This reduces the "what is value" problem into a "number go up" problem. As the thing we care about goes up, we can then mint tokens proportionately.

While it would be great if this was simple, it is not. It requires clearly stating an objective and knowing what you want to have happen. This is often the hardest part. The world, or at least your slice of it, needs to want the "value KPI" to be high otherwise the token isn't going to be valuable. 

If you construct this correctly:
- The KPI should represent what the community views as valuable.
- The token should be directly connected to that KPI.
- The policy should enforce the relationship of the token supply to the KPI so that when value creation goes up, the KPI goes up, and more tokens are minted.

A few words of warning:
- If `F` is gamable and/or `M` is not valuable, then the token will not be super valuable.
- The "spirit of `F`" is essential. This way you'll be able to clearly recognize an exploit vs the game itself. This way you'll know if you need to adjust the game, or if there's a bad actor that needs to be adjusted.
- It's essential that you can change the system if/when someone figures out how to game it or if/when what the community views as valuable changes. 

So... how do we actually do this? Well first, we need to start to figure out what we consider to be "valuable." What signals do we want to drive the token minting policy?
- new users?
- money in the DAO?
- SourceCred activity?
- etc...

> Note: you can use a single signal for your "value KPI" or you can use a combination of signals. The important part here is that they represent the things that the community cares about. Once you determine _what_ you think is valuable and _why_, then the challenge is using the best tools available to measure that value creation. We really like SourceCred for this task, however, there are many other tools you may want to use in this process. 

<Highlight color="red">Minting</Highlight>

How do we maintain a relationship between our measure of value and our continuous token supply? 

The control problem (`g`) is the most important part.  
- `f` is a business problem (see linked video)
- `g` is a math problem
- `allocation` is a governance problem

The system isolates 1 from 3 via 2 (the minting policy). This means that 1 and 3 can be flexibly, but 2 needs to be rooted in a solid cryptoeconomic policy. 

If minting relates to supply, then we need a policy based on m and k
- deta_s_t is a policy function of the previous k_t s_t

General pattern is solving the control theory problem
- want a policy that goes to 1 in the limit, but is not at 1 at any given time

<Highlight color="purple">Allocation</Highlight>

How do we want to allocate tokens after we mint them?

Minting is not business logic, it's a statement about a limit.
- You can get a mixture of flexibility and assertion through limiting properties 
- Need to make it so that people get the idea, but without having to do it themselves
- Keeping the limiting factor as a limiting policy gives it flexibility to oscilate around the real value, giving the system the ability to modulate as things change
- If you want the system to have good dynamic evolutionary properties need to talk about them in terms of limiting behavior 

Could mint into a vault of Grain

Then have a policy (slow/fast) to then release that to players (vesting)

DAO can design

slow/fast as community vesting or at the individual level

# Notes

Control theory
- controlling a physical process and driving it towards desired properties

> Talk about how the supply schedule is super important as well as various governance mechanisms (voting, court, validators) that can ensure that minting is done in a fair and reasonable way.

Things can be unbounded without actually being unbounded (percentages)

# Case Study: ETH2

measure KPI based on gas because gas is a measure of productivity of the network

want utilization value to grow relative to share of usage

more use cases drive demand, but gas is the floor
- swap gas for cred and we have a more fuzzy model of the same system

Cred for a SaaS project
- `f` as revenue of the community
- mint tokens based on belief of future revenue production

time is a very very important aspect of these things
