AraCred is a multi-disciplinary multi-mechanism initiative. As such, it is a team effort and would not be possible without the hard work. patience, and contributions of the community.  

Obviously, this would not be possible without [Aragon](https://aragon.org/) and [SourceCred](https://sourcecred.io/). Thank you for building a better future for us all.

Early on [CreDAO](https://github.com/1hive/credao) started exploring how to link SourceCred and DAOs. This is an extension of the theme [DAOnuts](https://github.com/daonuts) and [RecDAO](https://github.com/recdao): empowering communities on Web2 platforms to become self soveriegn and to recognize and reward contributors. Thank you [cslarson](https://github.com/cslarson) for tirelessly hacking away while the world catches up. You're a legend. 

In addition, the push to bring AraCred to market is a direct result of the [MetaGame](https://metagame.wtf/) community, esp [Hammadj](https://github.com/hammadj) (aka [METADREAMER](https://twitter.com/META_DREAMER)) who created the [SourceCred Discord plugin](https://github.com/metafam/thesource) which is the basis of the AraCred MVP. We started by building the AraCred system for MetaGame, then realized it could be generalized into something that could help many many more communities. Many thanks to the [MetaFam](https://github.com/metafam/) for continuously exploring the cutting edge of innovation and bringing that to reality. [The future really is here](https://interspace.metagame.wtf/), it's just not evenly distributed.

It should also be noted that the generalizable AraCred mechanism design would not exist as it does today without [Michael Zargham](https://github.com/mzargham). Thank you for exploring, explaining, and helping to sketch out the [tokeneconomics of AraCred](https://github.com/aracred/tokeneconomics). In the future very few will know why AraCred works, but they will know that it just works - and that's because of the work you're putting to make sure that we can accurately recognize and reward value creation. 

And now you! Many thanks for reading this page, exploring AraCred, and doing all the amazing things you do. We're glad you're here!
