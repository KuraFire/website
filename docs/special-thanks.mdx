AraCred is a multi-disciplinary multi-mechanism initiative. As such, it is a team effort and would not be possible without the hard work. patience, and contributions of the community.  

Obviously, this would not be possible without Aragon and SourceCred. Thank you for building a better future for us all.

Beyond that, the AraCred mechanism design would not be possible without Michael Zargham. Thank you for exploring, explaining, and helping to sketch out the tokeneconomics of AraCred.

In addition, the push to bring this system to market has been heavily motivated by the MetaGame community, esp METADREAMER. Thank you for continuously exploring the cutting edge of innovation, bringing that to reality with amazing plugins and tooling, and tirelessly explaining all of these awesome things to people over and over and over so that we can all realize this great dream in the Metaverse.

It should also be noted that this is an extension of CreDAO which is an extension of DAOnuts which is an extension of RecDAO. Thank you cslarson for tirelessly hacking away while the world caught up. You're a legend.
