This value is subjective based on our preferences and values. We use a lot of mechanisms to express those preferences such as emojis, messages, and payments.

Literally and figuratively. Outside of some very specific contexts, we don't have mechanisms to price ideas. This is odd because thinking (and thumbs) is what has enabled humans to become the dominant species on earth.

We only have ways to reward actions that created assets that can be rewarded by a market of buyers and sellers."),Object(o.b)("p",null,"AraCred changes this by creating a market for all the things. It does this by using SourceCred to page rank all the things. Page rank was originally used to score websites based not on how big they were, but based on how many other websites linked to them. If something was important, there's probably a good chance that people and things have referenced it. By applying this same process to graphs of contributions such as GitHub repos or community chats, we can get a similar sense for how much value a person or thing has provided to a project. As a result, value functions are no longer determined by those who have power and money. Instead, \"value\" is determined by the engagement of all the contributors to a project. This goes beyond markets of buyers and sellers to add in a third new thing: contributions. We've always had contributions, but SourceCred allows us to measure and manage them in ways that were unthinkable before. This moves us beyond the traditional game of finance (optimizing for a single reward function: money) and moves us into a meta-game of human coordination (where the player's preferences determine what is optimized for)."),Object(o.b)("p",null,"In short, the more people engage with your content, the more points you'll get. Different people like different things, so people's subjective preferences will determine the measure of that value rather than a fixed system.

Even with AraCred, that still is the baseline motivations of all the players.

It does not, however, intend to completely \"fix\" human coordination and collaboration. In fact, we don't even know if it will work at all! We're dogfooding it, however, and the results are encouraging. While nothing will ever be perfectly optimized, we feel like this is a step in the right direction. The journey to the ideal is more important than reaching the ideal. There is no end game. The only thing that matters is what we are doing today is better than what we are doing yesterday.
